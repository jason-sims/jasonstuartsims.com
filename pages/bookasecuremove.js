          <h2 className="uppercase py-4 text-[#B8D8D8] ">Background</h2>
          <p className="font-medium text-base text-justify leading-relaxed py-2">
            Since 1994, the Prisoner Escort and Custody Services (PECS) contract
            has outsourced the secure transport of prisoners across England &
            Wales including: adults; children and young people to and from
            Police Stations; Courts; Prisons; Secure Training Centres (STCs);
            and Secure Childrenâ€™s Schools (SCHs). On average 622,000 moves occur
            over any given year across the country, covering around 10.5 million
            miles of distance.
          </p>
          <p className="font-medium text-base text-justify leading-relaxed py-2">
            I was hired as Senior Product Manager to lead development of a
            digital service (Book a secure move) that would support the
            generation four contract.
          </p>

          <p className="font-medium text-base text-justify leading-relaxed py-2">
            The generation four contract would also introduce an updated fleet
            of escort vehicles with enhanced safety and security features,
            providing real-time data on the location of detainees and prisoners
            who are being moved to Book a secure move.
          </p>
          <p className="font-medium text-base text-justify leading-relaxed py-2">
            These changes would improve the efficiency of the PECS service as
            well as overall safety, security and decency for prisoners. The
            government would also realise significant benefits during the
            10-year term of the contracts such as reducing the number of delays
            at court, stopping mixed transportation of adult and youths and
            minimising the time a prisoner spends in a court cell or prison van.
          </p>
          <p className="font-medium text-base text-justify leading-relaxed py-2">
            I joined the programme team early in the bid phase and was tasked
            with outlining/scoring digital requirements for potential transport
            suppliers.
          </p>

          <h2 className="uppercase py-4 text-[#B8D8D8] ">Approach</h2>
          <p className="font-medium text-base text-justify leading-relaxed py-2">
            The bid phase enabled me to rapidly grow my understanding of PECS
            service, meet a wide range of users/stakeholders working with the
            programme, conduct initial research and quickly validate initial
            concepts for the service.
          </p>
          <p className="font-medium text-base text-justify leading-relaxed py-2">
            Suppliers had concerns around shaping their digital proposals,
            integration was a key concern as suppliers had a requirement to
            accept digital move requests and risk assessments. Previous
            contracts had relied on individual sites sending spreadsheets to the
            transport supplier with all other forms being paper based and
            provided at the point of pickup. Reporting as a result was
            restricted, the new contract provided an opportunity to deliver
            real-time reporting which would improve prisoner safety and identify
            operational efficiencies sooner.
          </p>

          <p className="font-medium text-base text-justify leading-relaxed py-2">
            We published a high level roadmap and draft API specification for
            the service, this would provide timelines for releases alongside
            collections/ resources that would support each release.
          </p>
          <p className="font-medium text-base text-justify leading-relaxed py-2">
            We adopted dual track agile which enabled us to learn and iterate
            quickly. The service was complex covering multiple business areas:

            Squads formed to focus on specific areas of the service alongside
            business change to ensure a shared understanding and develop
            relationships with stakeholders. We started with a limited number of
            sites initially who were willing to participate in research and test
            Alpha & Beta versions of the service.

            The service roll out was complex with:
          </p>
          <p className="font-medium text-base text-justify leading-relaxed py-2">
            <ul className="list-disc">
              <li>
                over 25k users across 772 sites (prisons/police custody/youth
                estate/courts)
              </li>

          </p>

          <p className="font-medium text-base text-justify leading-relaxed py-2">
            Our initial focus was on move requests from police custody, we found
            that as adoption increased in the business so did confidence. Any
            issues identified were quickly addressed, this was a key factor in
            growing confidence. A number of sites primarily used the service in
            the early hours of the morning which resulted in feedback at all
            hours but also helped shape an appropriate post live support model.
          </p>

          <p className="font-medium text-base text-justify leading-relaxed py-2">
            Suppliers were developing their services in parallel with
            integration assurance occurring in stages normally in the Limited
            Beta phase. We provided sites with the ability to generate email
            based move request summaries to ensure continuity of the service
            where integration assurance had not been finalised. Once suppliers
            were assured on the simple use cases we introduced more complex
            assurance.

                number of risk assessments started online vs completed online vs

          </p>

          <p className="font-medium text-base text-justify leading-relaxed py-2">
            Whilst simple these became good success indicators, numbers would
            vary by site and would be a good indicator that additional support
            or research was required.

          <p className="font-medium text-base text-justify leading-relaxed py-2">
            A large number of reports were developed over time to support
            compliance reporting providing valuable insights that previously
            were not available or required substantial manual effort to produce.

            Book a secure move was rolled out to all 772 sites in under 15
            months overcoming numerous challenges, including Covid. At the time
            of rollout the service achieved a 95% user satisfaction rating.

          <p className="font-medium text-base text-justify leading-relaxed py-2">
            Suppliers have fully integrated with the service, with real time
            data providing valuable insights and transforming reporting,
            compliance and billing. Most importantly the service has enabled
            improved safety, security and decency for prisoners through improved
            sharing of relevant risk information.
